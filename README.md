Employees Management 
 
    What this simple project actualy does?
     - I wanted to get familiar with hibernate, servlets and jsps so I had crated some
       entities and after that I wanted to use CRUD function on them. To handle http 
       requests form my webpage I used some servlets. For the frot end I used some css,
       js for validation and jsps pages. Now I can easily use CRUD function to manipulate those entities.
